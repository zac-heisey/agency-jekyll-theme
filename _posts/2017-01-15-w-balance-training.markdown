description: At RISE, we build on Gary Grayâ€™s powerful quote to help patients achieve improved balance throughout their journey of self evolution. Balance training benefits patients by decreasing fall risk, developing confidence in daily activities, increasing energy efficiency, reducing likelihood of injury, eliminating consequences of compensations, and increasing speed, strength, and power during athletic activities.
