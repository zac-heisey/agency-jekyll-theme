description: Not every patient at RISE is being treated for a musculoskeletal disorder. Many of our patients have had a disruption to other systems in the body and need help returning to the activities they enjoy. We help these individuals function optimally by challenging their bodies in safe, fun, and functional tasks. Some common non-orthopedic disorders that can be benefitted by physical therapy and neurological rehabilitation are Parkinson’s disease, CVA or “stroke”, pinched nerves, Multiple Sclerosis, headaches or migraines, and vertigo or dizziness.
