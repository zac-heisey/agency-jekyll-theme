bio: Sara discovered physical therapy as a patient herself. She learned that movement
  was a powerful healer and wanted to help others the way her physical therapist had
  helped her. Sara enjoys spending time practicing yoga, getting outdoors and taking
  care of her (way too many) plants. She holds a Doctorate in Physical Therapy from
  California State University, Northridge and is a Registered Yoga Teacher.
