Her passion for physical therapy grew when she had the opportunity to work with children and seeing how functional mobility can help improve their development and overall quality of life. She enjoys working with patients of all ages and backgrounds and hopes to help her patients reach their optimal potential. Outside of the clinic, Olga enjoys spending time with her family, as well as, going on camping adventures and occasionally baking a cake or two.
