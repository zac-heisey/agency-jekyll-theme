bio: Royal is a proud San Diego native who found his passion in physical therapy after experiencing his own injuries from weightlifting and playing sports. Fascinated by the science of human movement, he was inspired to pursue a profession where he could improve function, provide patient-centered care, promote long-term wellness and get people back to doing what they love. He received his Doctorate of Physical Therapy from University of St. Augustine. Outside of the clinic, he enjoys adventuring outdoors with friends & family, playing basketball, volleyball, fishing and working on cars.
