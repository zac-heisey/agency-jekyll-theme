bio: Katieâ€™s passion for movement began with her participation in sports growing up, including soccer, dance, water polo, and swim. She continued to learn about the human body while pursuing her undergraduate degree at UCLA and her Doctorate of Physical Therapy at the University of St Augustine in San Marcos. Katie loves to use her own experience with sports and movement to help others optimize their movement to be pain free and achieve their own personal goals. When not in the clinic she enjoys hiking, spending time outdoors, swimming, and cuddling with her cat Mango.
