bio: Deniz is originally from the Bay Area, but completed her undergraduate degree
  at SDSU and doctor of physical therapy from the University of St. Augustine. She
  grew up playing all sports, but her main passion is for soccer where an injury brought
  her into the world of PT. She knows full well what itâ€™s like to not be able to do
  the things you love due to pain. She hopes to help her patients live pain-free and
  improve their quality of life. Outside of work, she enjoys cooking, baking, and
  any outdoor activities.
