bio: Bridget grew up in North Dakota, but until recently has spent most of her adult
  life in NYC. After a career as a dancer in the musical theatre industry and a plethora
  of mild dance-related injuries, Bridget, returned to NYC and earned her Doctorate
  in Physical Therapy from New York University. Her experience as a dancer has taught
  her the importance of qualitative movement, a skill she proudly brings to her clients
  in the clinic. When not in the clinic she can be found hiking and exploring CA with
  her husband, son, and Beagle-mix "Riley."
