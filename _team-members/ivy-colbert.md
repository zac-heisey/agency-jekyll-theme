bio: Ivy is a physical therapist who specializes in orthopedics and Women’s Health physical therapy. In graduate school, she developed a passion for treating pelvic floor dysfunction. After receiving her doctorate in physical therapy at the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences, she went on to pursue further education for pelvic floor treatment through the Herman & Wallace Pelvic Rehabilitation Institute. She has worked in outpatient physical therapy, treating female pelvic floor dysfunction along with other various orthopedic conditions, utilizing skills in myofascial release, joint mobilization, trigger point release, and therapeutic exercise. She strives to treat the whole patient as she feels that consideration of their overall health and well-being is an important part of the rehabilitation process. When she isn’t treating clients, you can find her exercising outdoors or spending time with her husband, daughter and pug in beautiful San Diego, CA. She also loves a hot cup of chai tea, being by the ocean, and watching food and travel documentaries.
